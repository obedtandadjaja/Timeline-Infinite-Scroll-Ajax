# Timeline Infinite Scroll Ajax Plugin
I made this plugin specifically for Marc Bohler's (crusoe112) project, but anyone is free to use clone/fork it.

This plugin is made to show a timeline of messages, but with some tweaks you can use it for other purposes.

The AJAX will be called when the user nearly reaches the end of the page, and the plugin will populate the JSON response into timeline items and sort it accordingly

demo: http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/obedtandadjaja/Timeline-Infinite-Scroll-Ajax/blob/master/test.html

#### How to use
1. Clone this repository
2. Copy Paste the javascript and css to your project's directory
3. Look at the test.html for an example of how to use this plugin
4. Uncomment the AJAX
5. Modify the AJAX setting in the javascript according to your needs
6. Modify the icons, color, text size, etc. in the HTML and CSS files
